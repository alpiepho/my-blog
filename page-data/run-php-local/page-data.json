This really starts from the beginning.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try some of the samples without doing a lot of install\non my Mac (so hard to clean it up).  I found a YourTube video (sorry for missing a reference here), that showed how.  Very simple:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># from command line\n# cd to your project\nphp -S 127.0.0.1:8000 index.php </code></pre></div>\n<p>Then open a browser to localhost:8000</p>\n<p>It works on a simple hello world application.  With any luck it\nwill work of more complicated applications :)</p>\n<h3>Additional Notes</h3>\n<p>For the LinkedIn course, I had to cd to the level where public\nand private folders are (in Chapter 4, this was globe_bank).  Then\nuse URL directly the staff index.php:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">http://localhost:8000/public/staff/index.php</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Running PHP Locally (on Mac)","date":"06:01 PM, September 03, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/run-php-local/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fix-githunb-security-vulerability/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fixing Github Sercurity Warnings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/php-course-great/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"This PHP Course is Great..."}}}}}
