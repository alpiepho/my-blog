That\nis a good thing.  </p>\n<p>The bad thing is the packages that are flaged are usually sub\ndependencies of other packages…not things directly in the package.json file.</p>\n<p>My first thought was, “I’m not really dependent on the features\nof packaages X (say gastby), I’ll just upgrade everything”.  Bad idea! After using:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm outdate  # see what is out of date\nyarn upgrade # upgrade all the packages</code></pre></div>\n<p>I would sometimes get bad builds, or worse, run time errors that\ndidn’t show up until the app was deployed.  Reverting is ugly!</p>\n<p>So my workaround is to add the package that has been flagged\ndirectly in the package.json:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">yarn add eslint-utils</code></pre></div>\n<p>And add a Note to the end of the README.md so the change is more visable.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">## Updates for GitHub security issues\n\n- added eslint-utils directly to package.json (is a deep dependency)</code></pre></div>\n<p>This works and limits the impact of package changes on my working application, but still seems like a hack.  I hope there are not too many packages that need to be added over time.</p>\n<p>Maybe git hub should have an option to opt-in for something similar?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fixing Github Sercurity Warnings","date":"12:29 PM, September 02, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/fix-githunb-security-vulerability/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/simple-score-volleyball-pwa/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Simple Score Volleyball PWA"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/run-php-local/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running PHP Locally (on Mac)"}}}}}
